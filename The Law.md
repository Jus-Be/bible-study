Read Matthew 23:1-4

1. Read Malachi: 4. What does the prophecy of the coming messiah say about the law? Has this prophecy been fulfilled yet?

3. What does "Pharisees sit in Moses' seat" mean? (Read Exodus 20:18-22). Discuss

5. Is there a commandment from Jesus in these verses in Matthew? If so what is the commandment? 

7. Who were the Pharises? How do you fulfill this commandment of Jesus today? Read Act 1:4-8. Do we still need Pharisees? What has been done away with, Pharisees or the Law? Discuss. The spirit of God teaches the law now.

9. What did the Pharisees do that Jesus didn't like? Read Matthew 5:20 and Matthew 23:5-23. What is the modern equivalent today?

10. Read Galatians 5:22-23. Is the law against sin or against righteousness? Why is this verse interpretated as 'the law is done away with'? No law against the fruits of the spirit because these are fruits of righteousness not sin. 

11 Which laws grow these fruits? Read Exodus 20-23 and give examples. Can you give modern day examples of applying these laws today?
